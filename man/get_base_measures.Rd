\title{Compute Base Measure Weights}
\usage{
get_base_measures(sample, boundries, dim = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{A numeric vector or matrix of sample points. For 1D, a vector; for 2D, a matrix/data.frame with two columns.}

\item{boundries}{A numeric vector (length 2) for 1D defining min/max bounds, or a 2x2 matrix for 2D, each row defining min/max bounds of each axis.}

\item{dim}{Integer. Dimensionality of the sample: either 1 or 2.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of base measure weights.
}
\description{
Computes the base measure weights for either 1D (using grid midpoints) or 2D (using Voronoi tessellation).
}
\examples{
get_base_measures(sample = runif(100), boundries = c(0,1), dim = 1)
get_base_measures(sample = matrix(runif(200), ncol=2), boundries = matrix(c(0,1,0,1), nrow=2), dim = 2)
}
